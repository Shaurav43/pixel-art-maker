# Pixel Art Maker

 * Nanodegree: Intro to Programming
 * Module: JavaScript

## Project Summary

The project is a pixel art maker.<br/>
In this project, I have used my front-end programming skills including:
* Defining variables with `const` and `let`
* Accessing the `DOM` using methods of the `document` object
* Declaring functions and attaching them to DOM objects as `event listeners`
* Writing nested loops and using loop variables

## Main technologies

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Project Requirements

* The user can create a canvas of any (reasonable) size.
  * Entering whole numbers in the "Height" and "Width" fields, and submitting the form, causes an empty grid to appear on the page.
* The user can color the pixels in the grid.
  * Choosing a color from the color selector and clicking on a grid square causes that grid square (and only that square) to change color.
  * Event listeners are properly added to the grid squares (and not to the border or the table itself).
* The user can reset the grid to a blank state.
  * If there are already colored squares in the grid, clicking the Submit button clears them out.

## Code Quality
* The `script.js` JavaScript code works with the provided HTML and CSS files.
  * The `script.js` file is properly linked to the HTML file, and loading the HTML file shows the correct functionality for the application.
* Code is neatly formatted and commented.
  * Code is correctly indented, uses descriptive variable names for long-lived variables, and has descriptive comments.
* Code runs without errors in the JavaScript console.
  * Open the Developer Tools console tab, then create a grid and color some squares in it.<br/>You shouldn't see any error messages.
