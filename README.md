# pixel-art-maker
 
Hello guys and gals,
This is a simple pixel-art-maker project I made
I did the javascript part while HTML and the CSS part were provided by Udacity.
In this project, i learned about DOM and how to tinker with it
I have found that it could have been far easier if I were to add in jQuery
But, this project is based on javascript so i tried my best to do so
I am open for new suggestions to improve this project
